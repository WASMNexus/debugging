# WebAssembly Debugging Subgroup

This repository is for the Debugging Subgroup of the 
[WebAssembly Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/). Its
[Charter](Charter.md) describes the goals, scope and deliverables of the group.
The repository may contain reports, documentation, specifications and/or software
produced by the group (although larger projects may also have their own repositories).

Github issues filed in this repository may also be used for discussion of WebAssembly
debugging topics.


# Debugging Subgroup meetings

Meetings of the debugging Subgroup of the W3C WebAssembly Community Group (CG) follow
[the process of the CG](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings). If you wish to
attend, please join the W3C WebAssembly
[community group](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/) and contact
[Derek Schuff](dschuff@google.com) to be added to the meeting's calendar
invitation and receive the video call information.
